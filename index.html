        <!--Put Information on Basic HTML syntax, setup of an empty page, and basic info for CSS and how to link them. Tags should include
        stuff like img, link, title, head, body, div, nav, class, id, etc.-->
        <div class="basics">
            <p>Begin every HTML document with &lt;html&gt;</p>
            <p>The &lt;head&gt; tag is for information about the webpage such as what the title of that tab will be called 
                and where you link things like css stylesheets.</p>
            <p>The &lt;link&gt; tag has no closing tag and has 3 parts to it: 
                <ul>
                    <li>href, which is the name of the css file being linked,</li>
                    <li>type, the type of file being linked (which is usually css so text/css is what would be filled in),</li>
                    <li>and rel which defines the purpose of the file, which is usually just stylesheet.</li>
                </ul> 
            </p>
            <p>The &lt;body&gt; tag is where all of the actual HTML that will show up on the page goes</p>
